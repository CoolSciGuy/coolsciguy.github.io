(This website is under construction - here is my bio for now!)

Hey there, this is Amir. I am an environmental scientist by trade and a data scientist at heart. I have a PhD in Environmental sciences, and two degrees in Civil Engineering. I am currently serving the beautiful city of Washington DC, ensuring the health and integrity of streams in our nation's capital.

I have experience in teaching and guiding students through solving complicated problems. 

In my page, I will chronicle different data science and machine learning projects that I am working on. 


I am also a Home baker! here is one of the many breads I bake at home:
