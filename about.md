# About me

Hey there, this is Amir. I am an environmental scientist by trade, and a data scientist by heart. I have a PhD in Environmental sciences, and two degrees in Civil Engineering.

I am currently serving the beautiful city of **Washington DC** , ensuring the health and integrity of streams in our nation's capital.


In my page, I will chronicle different projects that I am working on.
