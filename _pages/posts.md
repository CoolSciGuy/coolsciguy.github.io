The bread and butter of any theme. Below you'll find the layouts included with Minimal Mistakes, what they look like and the type of content they've been built for.

### Layout based and user-defined classes

Class names corresponding to each layout are automatically added to the `<body>` element eg. `<body class="layout--single">`.

| layout           | class name                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| archive          | `.layout--archive`          |
| archive-taxonomy | `.layout--archive-taxonomy` |
| search           | `.layout--search`           |
| single           | `.layout--single`           |
| splash           | `.layout--splash`           |
| home             | `.layout--home`             |
| posts            | `.layout--posts`            |
| categories       | `.layout--categories`       |
| category         | `.layout--category`         |
| tags             | `.layout--tags`             |
| tag              | `.layout--tag`              |

Using YAML Front Matter you can also assign custom classes to target with CSS or JavaScript. Perfect for "art directed" posts or adding custom styles to specific pages.
